# About
<p>Hello, this repository should contain the implementations of the stuff that I find interesting on topic "Discrete-Time Signal Processing".</p>
<p>The implementations will be written in Python or C++ languages. Goal is growing the repository by the time passes and achieving the novel useful techniques which is not already in the literature.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python will be mainly used for workaround within main.ipynb notebook.</li>
  <li>Repository will be updated weekly with new implementations.</li>
  <li>Referenced books, papers and all stuff will be given in references section.</li>
</ul>
